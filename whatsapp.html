	<p><b>1. Hide "Last Seen" Timestamp</b></p>
	
	<p>By default, WhatsApp shows a "last seen" timestamp, telling other users the last time you were on WhatsApp. Some of you may want to disable this timestamp, for privacy reasons. You can disable this timestamp on both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>
If you’re an iOS user, you’re in luck, since all you need to do is go into <b>Settings > Chat Settings > Advanced</b> and set Last Seen Timestamp to Off.</p>

	<p>If you’re an Android user, you won’t have access to this setting from the app itself. Instead, you’re going to have to rely on a third party app such as Hide WhatsApp Status. The app disables your WiFi and data connection when you open WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Once you exit the app, your WiFi and data connections are reactivated, WhatsApp will sync, and your messages will be sent.</p>

	<p><b>2. Backup And Restore WhatsApp Chats</b></p>
	<p>
	WhatsApp makes automatic backups of your chats, but you can also make a manual backup. On iOS, it’s Settings > Chat <b>Settings > Chat Backup,</b> then tap Back Up Now.<br>
	</p>
<p>On Android, just go into <b>Settings > Chat</b> settings and tap Backup conversations to create a backup. This won’t backup your media, so you’ll need to use a file manager to copy the media folders in /sdcard/WhatsApp/Media.</p>
	<img  src="img/Whatsapp/002.jpg" ><p>
	
	There’s no way to restore chats directly from WhatsApp, so if you want to restore a backup you’re going to have to uninstall and reinstall WhatsApp. When you start WhatsApp after the reinstall, you should be prompted to restore your most recent backup. Just follow the procedure and your chats should all be back.

	<p><b>3. Stop WhatsApp Images from Appearing In Gallery Or Camera Roll</b></p>
	<p>
	Having WhatsApp images in your Gallery or Camera Roll can be very annoying; maybe the images are somewhat private, or you just don’t like having these images clutter up your Gallery or Camera Roll. You can fix this on both iOS and Android.
</p>
<p>On iOS, it’s pretty simple; just go to Settings > Privacy > Photos and then turn the WhatsApp switch off.</p>

	<p>
	On Android, you have to create a .nomedia file in WhatsApp’s images or video directories. To do this, you need a file explorer such as ES File Explorer. Navigate to the images or video folders. Tap the New button in the lower left, pick File and create a file named .nomedia. This will stop the Gallery from scanning the folder.
