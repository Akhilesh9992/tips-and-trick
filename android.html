	<p><b>1. Enable Developer Mode</b></p>
	
	<p>Ok, this is one of the more widely known tricks, but it’s important nonetheless, so we are going to include it.</p>
	<img  src="img/Android/002.png" >
	<p>
	One solution is to change your phone’s “Window animation scale”, “Transition animation scale” and “Animator duration scale” from 1x to 0.5x. Granted, it won’t actually make your phone faster, but it will make it feel faster.<br>
	</p>
<p>Navigate to <b>Settings > About phone</b> and tap on your phone’s build number seven times. You’ll get an onscreen countdown, eventually followed by a message saying “Congratulations, you are now a developer”.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="fbimg">
	<p><b>2. Change the Animation Scales</b></p>
	<p>
	For the most part, the latest Android phones already feel very snappy.</p>
<p>There are also lots of popular entry-level phones that come with slower processors and only 1GB or 2GB of RAM.</p>

	</p>

<p>Go to <b>Settings > Developer options</b> and scroll about two thirds of the way down the list to find the necessary options (you’ll need to have first enabled Developer Mode).
	</p>
	</div>	
	
	
	
	<div class="fbimg">
	<p><b>3. Clear App Defaults</b></p>
	
	<p>
	It’s annoying when a link opens in a certain app rather than in the browser. It could be a YouTube link, a tweet, or a Facebook page — you’ll end up waiting around while your phone shuts down Chrome (or your browser of choice) and fires up something else.<br>
	</p>
<p>It’s easily fixed.</p>
<p>Go to <b>Settings > Apps</b> and find the app that keeps opening. Once there, scroll down to <b>Open by default</b>, press it, and then select <b>Clear Defaults</b>.<br>
	</p>
<p>If that doesn’t work, try doing the same with your browser app as well.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fbimg">
	<p><b>4. Locate Annoying Notifications</b></p>
	<p>
	Do you keep getting an annoying app notification, but you’re not sure which app is causing it?</p>
<p>There is an easy solution — just long-press on the notification in question, and your device will tell you.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="fbimg">
	<p><b>5. Manage App Notifications</b></p>
	<p>
	Moving on one step further from the previous tip, after you’ve long-pressed the app you’ll see an information icon. Press it, and you’ll be presented with the notification settings for the app in question.<br>
	</p>
	<img  src="img/Android/003.png" >
	<p>
	You can do things like block all its notifications, allow it to override priority mode, and make it hide private information.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fbimg">
	<p><b>6. Priority Mode</b>
	</p>
	<p>Priority mode is probably one of the most underrated and underused features on the entire operating system.
	</p>
	<p>In short, it allows you to put your phone into quiet mode, but still allow some “noises” to get through. This could be calls, texts, or WhatsApps from specific contacts, notifications from certain apps, or important alerts such as alarms.
</p>
<p>To set it up, go to <b>Settings > Sound & Notification > Do not disturb</b>, then select the options that you require.
</p>
<p>It can be quickly toggled on and off from the Quick Settings menu.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="fbimg">
	<p><b>7. Screen Pinning</b></p>
	<p>If you have kids using your phone regularly, this is a great way to make sure they don’t accident run up huge bills or set their eyes on content that is age-inappropriate.
</p>
<p>Firstly, you’ll need to enable the feature (oddly, it is turned off by default). Do that by going to <b>Settings > Security</b> and scrolling down to <b>Screen pinning</b>.
</p>
<p>To pin a screen, open the app, press the <b>Overview</b> button (the square) and then the pin icon.
</p>
<p>You can choose to PIN-protect the pinned screen, if you so wish.
